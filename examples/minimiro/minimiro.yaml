scores:

    # you can add more scores to this list one one score will be made for each output
    # e.g. :
    # - 2000
genes: False # if you set this to True out must include a gff compatible with liftoff (see commented out line below)
simple: False # if this value is set to true the code will only make the duplicon tracks and none of the other minimiro output (good when there is lot of sequences).
infer: True # Try to infer the orientation of the query sequences that will have the majority of sequence in the same direction.

example_prefix: # a name which will prefix the outputs (can be anything without spaces)
    ref: ref.fa
    # gff: /path/to/genes.gff3 # a full path to a gff3 file for your reference that is compatible with liftoff
    regions:
        # one or more regions in the "samtools faidx format" to include from the ref
      - chr8 # you can add ":\d+-\d+" to sepecify a subregion instead of a whole contig
    query: query.fa
    queryregions:
        - chr8_contig # same options possible as in the reference "regions"
    # if you want to reverse complement the query you can uncomment the flag below
    # rc: True 

# you can add more regions to compare by making an entry like the one above with a unique name
